# projectBattleships
 First game
Battleship Pre-project Planning

Game Outline

1. 2 players
2. Each player receives a square grid(width tbd) 
3. Each player also receives a set of ships(ships amount tbd)
4. Each of the ships will be assigned coordinates that corresponds to the player’s grid
5. Each player take turns to guess 1 ship coordinate
6. Each guess is unique and cannot be repeated 
7. First player to successfully guess all of the other players’ ship coordinates win 


Minimum Viable Product

1. 5x5 grid
2. Play against human opponent 
3. 3 ships
4. Ship length = 1
5. Guessing ship coordinate mechanism works
6. What happens when guess correctly, what happens when guess incorrectly
7. End turn function
8. Win state

For Future Development

1. Make online multi-player viable
2. Multiple ship classes with varying lengths
3. Variable grid size
4. Make the ships move at the end of every turn
