Battleship Pre-project Planning

Game Outline

2 players
Each player receives a square grid(width tbd) 
Each player also receives a set of ships(ships amount tbd)
Each of the ships will be assigned coordinates that corresponds to the player’s grid
Each player take turns to guess 1 ship coordinate
Each guess is unique and cannot be repeated 
First player to successfully guess all of the other players’ ship coordinates win 


Minimum Viable Product

5x5 grid
Play against computer opponent 
2 ships
Ship length = 1
Guessing ship coordinate mechanism works
What happens when guess correctly, what happens when guess incorrectly
End turn function
Win state

Set up

Players receive grid and ships.
Players assign ships to grid. (Eg.  If ship length = 1 ∴ ships occupy 1 square thus having 1 grid coordinates)





Start

Player 1 guesses ship coordinates for cpu
If wrong, end turn. If right, celebrate then end turn
Cpu guesses 
Repeat step 2
